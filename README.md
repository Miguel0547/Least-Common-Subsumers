# Least-Common-Subsumers
Lab03 is to help us become familiar with interacting with the Ontology and Concept classes from the code provided to us in ontology.py. 
This will implement two ways of calculating LCS and a measure of semantic similarity. 
When ran, the program will load an ontology, calculate the semantic similarity of every pair of concepts, and then output the list of pairs in acceding order of similarity.
