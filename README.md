# Least-Common-Subsumers
Lab03 is to help us become familiar with interacting with the Ontology and Concept classes from the code provided to us in ontology.py. 
This will implement two ways of calculating LCS and a measure of semantic similarity. 
When ran, the program will load an ontology, calculate the semantic similarity of every pair of concepts, and then output the list of pairs in acceding order of similarity.
Outcome:
Function that performs a linear search to find the Least Common Subsumer between two concepts.
Function that performs a recursive Binary Search to find the least common subsumer between two concepts.
Function that calculates the similarity measure defined as the size of the intersection of subsumers divided by the size of the union of subsumers.
Function that performs a quick sort based off of their similarity scores in ascending order.
